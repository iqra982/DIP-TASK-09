# DIP-Task_9
Task 09
This project features a comprehensive color image analysis tool developed using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The program allows users to upload images at runtime to perform advanced processing tasks, including grayscale conversion, RGB channel extraction, and transformation into multiple color spaces such as HSV, YCbCr, and Lab. It implements White Balance correction using the Gray World assumption and utilizes HSV color masking to isolate specific colors like green. Finally, the system applies image segmentation (e.g., thresholding on the Lab 'a' channel) to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of segmentation techniques across different color models through detailed visual analysis.
